This is an unofficial copy of the [wp_cassify WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cassify/).  As of this writing (9/5/2023), is it not supported by PHP8 and will throw a fatal error. The version in this repo is tweaked to avoid failures, and is working in my WordPress instances that require it. To use this version of wp-cassify, please do the following:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Rename the directory to 'wp-cassify'.
3. In your WordPress installation, delete the current wp-cassify directory and replace it with this one.

This will be minimally maintained, and may not work in the future. Please use carefully.
